# Bluetooth Low-Energy Earrings

A set of bluetooth BLE earrings inspired by the movie blade runner.

Including custom pendant, earring and earring charging dock PCBs; custom 3D printed enclosure; embedded solution on NRF52833 and bluetooth app.

This earring blink different colours dependant on messages sent over Bluetooth by the bluetooth app. The solution includes a pendant that holds the LED and is connected by wiring that passes through the ear piercing; the earring itself that sits behind the ear and a charging and programming dock including USB hub. The earrings are flashed and charged over USB C connectors and are powered by drone batteries so include custom charge protection and power path management circuits.

Project phase: PCB ordered and received, BOM finalised and ordered, first revision of enclosure made, first iteration of the embedded solution.

Next step: test PCBs and NRF52833 code, order batteries, print enclosure, start developing the app.
